 The identity of the Stoneman is still unknown, and the number of victims is disputed, but it is believed that the killer was responsible for the deaths of at least 13 people. The Stoneman's victims were typically homeless or destitute, and they were bludgeoned to death with a large stone or concrete slab while they slept. The killer would then disappear into the night, leaving behind no clues or evidence. Despite a massive manhunt and widespread panic, the Stoneman was never caught, and the murders eventually stopped. The identity and motives of the Stoneman remain a mystery, and the case has become one of the most enduring unsolved mysteries in Indian history.
