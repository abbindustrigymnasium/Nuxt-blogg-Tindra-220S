Yang is believed to have been responsible for the deaths of at least 67 people, although the actual number may be much higher. His victims were often farmers, whom he would attack with a hammer or other blunt object while they slept. Yang's crimes were eventually discovered when he was caught trying to break into a house in 2003. After his arrest, he confessed to the murders and provided detailed information about his crimes. Yang was found guilty and sentenced to death, and he was executed in 2004. Yang's case is considered one of the worst instances of serial killing in Chinese history, and it shocked the nation and the world.
