 Haarmann was responsible for the deaths of at least 24 young men and boys, who he lured with the promise of money or alcohol. He would then strangle or bite his victims, dismember their bodies, and dispose of their remains. Haarmann's victims were typically impoverished or homeless, and he took advantage of their vulnerable situations. Haarmann's crimes were eventually discovered when one of his victims escaped and alerted the police. Haarmann was arrested and confessed to the murders, claiming that he was driven by a compulsion that he could not control. He was found guilty and sentenced to death, and was executed by beheading in 1925. Haarmann's crimes shocked Germany and the world, and he remains one of the most infamous serial killers in history.
