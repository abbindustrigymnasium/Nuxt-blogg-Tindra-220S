 The killer, whose true identity has never been confirmed, is believed to have been responsible for at least five murders of prostitutes, all of whom were brutally mutilated. The victims of Jack the Ripper, also known as the "canonical five," were Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes, and Mary Jane Kelly. The murders were particularly gruesome, with the victims' throats being slashed and their bodies being mutilated in various ways. Jack the Ripper was known for his surgical precision and ability to quickly disappear from the crime scenes, leading many to believe that he had medical knowledge or training. Despite numerous suspects and investigations over the years, Jack the Ripper was never caught, and his identity remains one of the greatest mysteries in criminal history.
