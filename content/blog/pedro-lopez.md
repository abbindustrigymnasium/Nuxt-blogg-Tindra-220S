Pedro Lopez, also known as the "Monster of the Andes," was a Colombian serial killer who operated in Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru in the 1970s and 1980s.

Lopez is believed to have been responsible for the deaths of at least 110 young girls, although the actual number may be much higher. Lopez would lure his victims away from their homes, often using promises of money or gifts, before raping and killing them. He would then leave their bodies in secluded areas. Lopez's crimes were eventually discovered when he was caught attempting to abduct another young girl. After his arrest, he confessed to the murders and provided detailed information about his crimes. Lopez was found guilty and sentenced to prison, but was released in 1998 for good behavior. He was then deported back to Colombia, where he was arrested again and charged with the murder of a nine-year-old girl. Lopez is currently serving a 16-year sentence in prison for that crime. His case remains one of the most shocking and disturbing in modern history.
