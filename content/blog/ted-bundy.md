He would often lure his victims into his car by pretending to be injured or disabled, before attacking and killing them. Bundy would then dispose of their bodies in remote locations. Bundy's crimes were eventually discovered when he was pulled over for a traffic violation and police found evidence of his crimes in his car. After his arrest, Bundy escaped from custody twice and was recaptured both times. He was found guilty of multiple counts of murder and was sentenced to death. Bundy's charisma and intelligence made him one of the most infamous serial killers in history, and he remains a subject of fascination and horror to this day.
