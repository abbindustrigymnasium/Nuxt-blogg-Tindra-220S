The **BTK Killer**, also known as Dennis Rader, was a notorious American serial killer who operated in Kansas from the 1970s to the early 2000s.

The moniker "BTK" stood for "bind, torture, kill," which was Rader's modus operandi. Rader was responsible for the deaths of ten people, including men, women, and children. 
The victims were often targeted randomly and lived in the Wichita area. Rader would break into their homes and bind, torture, and kill them in a ritualistic manner. The victims of the BTK Killer included Joseph Otero, Julie Otero, Josephine Otero, Kathryn Bright, Shirley Vian Relford, 
Nancy Fox, Marine Hedge, Vicki Wegerle, and Dolores Davis. Despite sending numerous taunting letters to the media and police, Rader evaded capture for decades. He was finally caught in 2005, after sending a floppy disk to the police that contained metadata that could be traced back to his church. Rader was sentenced to 10 consecutive life sentences and is currently serving his sentence in prison
