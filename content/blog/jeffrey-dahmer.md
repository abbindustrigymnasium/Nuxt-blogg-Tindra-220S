 Dahmer was responsible for the deaths of 17 young men and boys, whom he lured with the promise of money or sex. He would then strangle or drug his victims, perform sexual acts on their bodies, and dismember their remains. Dahmer's crimes were eventually discovered when one of his victims escaped and alerted the police. When they searched Dahmer's apartment, they found evidence of his crimes, including human body parts in his refrigerator and freezer. Dahmer was arrested and confessed to the murders, claiming that he had a compulsion that he could not control. He was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison, but was later beaten to death by another inmate. Dahmer's crimes shocked the world and sparked a debate about mental illness and criminal responsibility.
